# String Similarity Using Dynamic Programming

## Project Description

When performing a Google search, you may have noticed that if you misspell a word, Google suggests the correct spelling. For example, if you search for "inplememtation," Google provides results for the correctly spelled "implementation."

How does Google achieve this? As a simple solution, we can define criteria to make the best possible prediction of a likely string. Letâ€™s denote the search string as \( S1 \) and the predicted string as \( S2 \). Our criteria should return a measure of similarity between the two strings, from which we can select the most suitable \( S2 \).

### Problem A: Edit Distance

For the first criterion, we consider the edit distance between \( S1 \) and \( S2 \) using three operations: deletion, insertion, and substitution. The cost for deletion and insertion is 1, while the cost for substitution is 2. For example, to transform "index" into "inside," two possible paths are shown:

Using dynamic programming, we compute the minimum cost to transform \( S1 \) into \( S2 \) along with the chosen operations. According to this criterion, the lower the cost, the more suitable the candidate string \( S2 \) will be.


To compute the cost of converting one word into another, the process involves starting from the last characters of both words and considering three cases:

 - Matching Characters: If the last characters of both words are the same, no operation is needed. The cost is 0, and the problem reduces to the remaining substrings.

 - Different Characters: If the last characters differ, we compute the cost of three operations:
   - Insertion: Insert the last character of the second word into the first.
   
   - Deletion: Delete the last character of the first word.
   
   - Substitution: Replace the last character of the first word with the last character of the second word. This is like matching but includes the cost of the substitution operation.

- Empty Substring: If either word is empty, the cost is the number of remaining characters in the non-empty word, as all characters need to be inserted.

We use Dynamic programming to solve this by storing results of subproblems in a matrix. The matrix is filled in a bottom-up manner by applying the three cases. By tracing back from the matrix, we can determine the sequence of operations that achieved the minimum cost:

```python
def Min_Edit_Cost(m, n, S1, S2):

    memorization = [[0 for i in range(n + 1)] for j in range(m + 1)]

    for i in range(m + 1):
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if i == 0:
                memorization[i][j] = j    
                memorization[i][j] = i   

            elif S1[i-1] == S2[j-1]:
                memorization[i][j] = memorization[i-1][j-1]
 
            else:
                memorization[i][j] = min(1 + memorization[i][j-1],        # Insert
                                         1 + memorization[i-1][j],        # Remove
                                         2 + memorization[i-1][j-1])    # Replace
 
    return memorization[m][n]
```

Checking the algorithm with the words given in the question, we get the following result:


```python
S1 = 'index'
S2 = 'inside'
m = len(S1)
n = len(S2)
ans = Min_Edit_Cost(m, n, S1, S2)
print('The Min Cost to convert these 2 words to each other = ', ans)
```

```
The Min Cost to convert these 2 words to each other =  3
```


### Problem B: Longest Common Subsequence

For the second criterion, we define the concept of a subsequence of a string. A subsequence of string \( S \) is any subset of its characters that appears in the same order as in \( S \). For example, the string "aca" is a subsequence of the string "abcba."

The longest common subsequence between two strings \( S1 \) and \( S2 \) is the set of characters that appear in both strings as subsequences. For example, consider two strings:


<img src="images/2.png" width="600"/>


Using dynamic programming, we find the length of the longest common subsequence between two given strings \( S1 \) and \( S2 \). According to this criterion, the longer the length of the common subsequence, the more suitable the candidate string \( S2 \) will be.


For this, we use top-down dynamic programming with memorization to store the values of the previous subproblems. We start examining each of the sequences from their last letter. There are 2 cases:

- The last letters of the 2 words are identical. In this case, I store the value 1 for the length of the common subsequence, and move on to the letter before that and examine the new subsequence.
- The second case is when the last letters of the 2 words are different. In this case, I check two different subsequences. Considering length(S1) = n and length(S2) = m:

  
First, we check the Longest Common Subsequent between S1[n-1] and S2[m], and the second, the Longest Common Subsequent between S1[n] and S2[m1]. We return the longer subsequent in these 2 cases. This algorithm works recursively and since the same subproblems can get computed repeatedly, subproblem solutions are memorized rather than being computed every time.

```python
def Longest_Subsequence(S1, S2, len_s1, len_s2, memory_dict):

    if len_s1 == 0 or len_s2 == 0:
        return 0

    sequence = (len_s1, len_s2)

    if sequence not in memory_dict:

        if S1[len_s1 - 1] == S2[len_s2 - 1]:
            memory_dict[sequence] = Longest_Subsequence(S1, S2, len_s1 - 1, len_s2 - 1, memory_dict) + 1

        else:
            memory_dict[sequence] = max(Longest_Subsequence(S1, S2, len_s1, len_s2 - 1, memory_dict),
                            Longest_Subsequence(S1, S2, len_s1 - 1, len_s2, memory_dict))
 
    return memory_dict[sequence]
```


We store a key for each of the sequences the algorithm finds (memorization), and run the above function. Checking the function for the given sequences in the question:


```python
S1 = 'abdacbab'
S2 = 'acfbeca'
memory_dict = {}
Solution = Longest_Subsequence(S1, S2, len(S1), len(S2), memory_dict)
print('Length of the longest common sequence between S1 and S2 = ', Solution)
```

```
Length of the longest common sequence between S1 and S2 =  4
```
